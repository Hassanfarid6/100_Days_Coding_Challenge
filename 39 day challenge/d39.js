/*Day 39 Challenge: Start Coding!* ðŸš€

*Question 115:* Use a switch statement to log the days of the week based on a number (1-7).

*Explain & TIP:* A switch statement is a great way to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
It's particularly useful for scenarios like mapping numbers to days of the week.

// This function logs the day of the week based on a number (1-7)
function logDayOfWeek(dayNumber) {
    switch (dayNumber) {
        case 1:
            console.log("Sunday");
            break;
        case 2:
            console.log("Monday");
            break;
        case 3:
            console.log("Tuesday");
            break;
        case 4:
            console.log("Wednesday");
            break;
        case 5:
            console.log("Thursday");
            break;
        case 6:
            console.log("Friday");
            break;
        case 7:
            console.log("Saturday");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Invalid day number");
            break;
    }
}
logDayOfWeek(2); // Outputs: Tuesday
// Uses a switch statement to select the appropriate day based on the provided number.
/*Question 116:* Create a switch case that matches several cases to the same code block, representing seasons.

*Explain & TIP:* You can group multiple case statements together when they should execute the same block of code,
 which is handy for categorizing items into broader groups.

/*Question 117:* Implement a switch statement that evaluates an expression and uses the default case
if none of the cases match.

*Explain & TIP:* The default case in a switch statement provides a way to execute a block of code when
 none of the other case labels match the expression's value.
