/*Question 118:* Write a loop that logs numbers from 1 to 10 to the console.

*Explain & TIP:* A for loop is a concise way to run a block of code a specific number of times.
 It's perfect for when you know exactly how many iterations you need.

for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    //   console.log(i);
}
/*Question 119:* Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.

*Explain & TIP:* A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. Itâ€™s ideal for when
 you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.


||https://github.com/AsharibAli/discord-100-days-coding-challenge/tree/main/day-40/q119||*/
var count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    // console.log("Hello, World!");
    count++;
}
// Initializes a counter
var counts = 0;
// This while loop runs until count is 5
while (counts < 5) {
    //   console.log("Hello, World!"); // Logs "Hello, World!"
    counts++; // Increments count by 1
}
// Repeats logging "Hello, World!" 5 times, once per loop iteration.
/*Question 120:* Use a for...of loop to iterate through an array of your favorite movies and log each one.

*Explain & TIP:* The for...of loop is a modern loop introduced in ES6, designed to iterate over iterable objects
like arrays, strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more, making it very readable and easy to use.

*Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!*
