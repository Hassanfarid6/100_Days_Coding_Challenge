/*Day 47 Challenge: Start Coding!*

**Question 139:** List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use case for each.

**Explain & TIP:** Reserved words in JavaScript are words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as
identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). Understanding these can help prevent syntax errors and
make your code more readable.*/
// Reserved word: let - used to declare a block-scoped local variable
var count = 5;
// Reserved word: if - used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true
if (count > 0) {
    console.log("Count is greater than 0.");
}
// Reserved word: return - used to exit a function and return a value from that function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
// Demonstrates valid use cases for the reserved words 'let', 'if', and 'return'.

/*Question 140:** Explain the error that occurs when trying to use a reserved word as a variable name.

**Explain & TIP:** Attempting to use a reserved word as a variable name will cause a syntax error in JavaScript.
 This is because reserved words have predefined meanings and uses in the language syntax.*/
/****************************************************************************************************************** */
/*Question 141:** Discuss the significance of the `await` reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript.

**Explain & TIP:** The `await` operator is used to wait for a `Promise` to settle. It can only be used inside an `async` function. Using `await` makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code, which can make it easier to understand and debug.
